# Code of Conduct

I'll keep it simple. There's one expectation: be kind.

Contributions, questions, and constructive criticism are welcome. Rudeness and other foolishness will simply not be tolerated. This project should _only_ be used for the purposes already otherwise stated in the documentation.

Anyone who contributes to this project deserves to be recognized and should add themselves in the `package.json` file as a contributor of the project.

If you have any questions, please file an issue in this repository and I will respond as quickly as I am able.
