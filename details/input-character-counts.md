## Point of Failure
The character counts for `<input>` elements should be made available to screen readers.

## Automation

### Linting
Cannot exist yet. How would you programmatically identify something as a character count so an automated linting check could occur?

### Testing
How would you programmatically identify something as a character count, so that an automated test could occur?

### Developer Authored Test
Developers should ensure that their code does not violate this rule, and write a test that prevents regressions in code if it is later changed.

### Manual Test
Review page and ensure the point of failure does not exist, inspecting the DOM where required.
