# Potential A11y Violation:<br/>{{ $frontmatter.title }}

## Point of Failure

The complementary landmark (aside) should be a direct descendant of the body element.

## Available Automation Evaluation

In checking known available linting and testing tools, these are our findings.

### Linting <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.linting) }}</Badge>

It does not seem possible to have an automated test for this potential failure, yet. If you think it can, please [file an issue on this app's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MelSumner/a11y-automation/issues).

### Testing <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.testing) }}</Badge>

See the [`axe-core`](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) library for the `landmark-complementary-is-top-level` rule.

## Other Test Methods

In addition to automated tests, there are other types of tests that could be conducted to prevent this potential violation.

### Developer Authored Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.author) }}</Badge>

Take a little time to evaluate the whole page. Is there an element with the role of complementary that is not the direct descendant of the body element? Can you write a test to prevent this in the future?

### Manual Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.manual) }}</Badge>

Review page and ensure the point of failure does not exist, inspecting the DOM where required.
