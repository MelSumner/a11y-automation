## Point of Failure

CSS should not be used to make a paragraph or other plain text look like a heading.

## Automation

### Linting

Potentially automatable with a CSS linter.

### Testing

See rule `p-as-heading` in the `axe-core` a11y testing library.

### Developer Authored Test

Developers should ensure that their code does not violate this rule, and write a test that prevents regressions in code if it is later changed.

### Manual Test

Inspect headings and ensure that they are using the appropriate semantic equivalent (h1-h6).
