## Point of Failure

Required `input` fields should use the HTML `required` attribute correctly. This attribute is used to indicate that a field must be filled out before submitting a form.

## Automation

### Linting

Potentially automatable.  

### Testing

Potentially automatable. Check for presence of common required indicators and make sure the `required` attribute also exists.

### Developer Authored Test

Developers should ensure that their code does not violate this rule, and write a test that prevents regressions in code if it is later changed.

### Manual Test

Review input fields for common required indicators. Inspect the DOM to ensure that the `required` attribute is present on those fields.
