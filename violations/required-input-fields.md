# Potential A11y Violation:<br/>{{ $frontmatter.title }}

## Point of Failure

Required `input` fields should use the HTML `required` attribute correctly. This attribute is used to indicate that a field must be filled out before submitting a form.

## Available Automation Evaluation

In checking known available linting and testing tools, these are our findings.

### Linting <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.linting) }}</Badge>

It's possible that a linting rule could be created for this potential failure.  

### Testing <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.testing) }}</Badge>

It's possible that a check could be created for this potential failure. Check for presence of common required indicators and make sure the `required` attribute also exists.

## Other Test Methods

In addition to automated tests, there are other types of tests that could be conducted to prevent this potential violation.

### Developer Authored Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.author) }}</Badge>

Developers should make sure that their code does not violate this rule, and try to write a test that would prevent a regression in accessibility if the code is later changed.

### Manual Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.manual) }}</Badge>

Review input fields for common required indicators. Inspect the DOM to ensure that the `required` attribute is present on those fields.
