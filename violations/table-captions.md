# Potential A11y Violation:<br/>{{ $frontmatter.title }}

## Point of Failure

Tables with a caption should use the `<caption>` element.

## Available Automation Evaluation

In checking known available linting and testing tools, these are our findings.

### Linting <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.linting) }}</Badge>

It does not seem possible to have an automated test for this potential failure, yet. No programmatic way to determine if something is a caption for tabular data.

### Testing <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.testing) }}</Badge>

Automated testing exists. See the [`axe-core`](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) library for the `table-fake-caption` rule.

## Other Test Methods

In addition to automated tests, there are other types of tests that could be conducted to prevent this potential violation.

### Developer Authored Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.author) }}</Badge>

Developers should make sure that their code does not violate this rule, and try to write a test that would prevent a regression in accessibility if the code is later changed.

### Manual Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.manual) }}</Badge>

Review page and ensure the point of failure does not exist, inspecting the DOM where required.
