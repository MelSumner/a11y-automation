## Point of Failure

Text look-alikes such as glyphs or [character entities](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/named-characters.html#named-character-references) should not be used to represent text without providing a text alternative.

## Automation

### Linting

Potentially automatable.

If you have any ideas about how this could be done, please [file an issue on this app's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MelSumner/a11y-automation/issues).

### Testing

Potentially automatable.

If you have any ideas about how this could be done, please [file an issue on this app's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MelSumner/a11y-automation/issues).

### Developer Authored Test

Ensure that glyphs and character entities have a text alternative. Write a test to ensure that this code does not regress if changed.

### Manual Test

Review page and ensure the point of failure does not exist, inspecting the DOM where required.
