# Potential A11y Violation:<br/>{{ $frontmatter.title }}

## Point of Failure

Text look-alikes such as glyphs or [character entities](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/named-characters.html#named-character-references) should not be used to represent text without providing a text alternative.

## Available Automation Evaluation

In checking known available linting and testing tools, these are our findings.

## Other Test Methods

In addition to automated tests, there are other types of tests that could be conducted to prevent this potential violation.

### Developer Authored Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.author) }}</Badge>

Ensure that glyphs and character entities have a text alternative. Write a test to ensure that this code does not regress if changed.

### Manual Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.manual) }}</Badge>

Review page and ensure the point of failure does not exist, inspecting the DOM where required.
