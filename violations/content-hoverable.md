# Potential A11y Violation:<br/>{{ $frontmatter.title }}

## Point of Failure

Content that is shown on hover or focus should be dismissible, not disappear when the mouse moves between the hoverable item and the content that appears, and should persist for the user. See [Failure 95](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/failures/F95) for examples.

## Available Automation Evaluation

In checking known available linting and testing tools, these are our findings.

### Linting <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.linting) }}</Badge>

It does not seem possible to have an automated test for this potential failure, yet. If you an idea about how this could be linted in an automated fashion, or are aware of an automated linting rule that already exists, please [file an issue on this app's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MelSumner/a11y-automation/issues).

### Testing <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.testing) }}</Badge>

It does not seem possible to have an automated test for this potential failure, yet. If you an idea about how this could be tested in an automated fashion, or are aware of an automated test that already exists, please [file an issue on this app's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MelSumner/a11y-automation/issues).

## Other Test Methods

In addition to automated tests, there are other types of tests that could be conducted to prevent this potential violation.

### Developer Authored Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.author) }}</Badge>

Developers should try out the content they make available on hover or focus. How easy is it to use? Can it be dismissed with the ESC key? Is it easy to keep open while moving the mouse from the trigger and the content that is shown?

### Manual Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.manual) }}</Badge>

Review page and ensure the point of failure does not exist, inspecting the DOM where required.
