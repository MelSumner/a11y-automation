# Potential A11y Violation:<br/>{{ $frontmatter.title }}

## Point of Failure
An icon should not be the only thing that conveys information to the user.

## Available Automation Evaluation

In checking known available linting and testing tools, these are our findings.

### Linting <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.linting) }}</Badge>
It's possible that a linting rule could be created for this potential failure. Search template for text nodes where the only item is an icon.

### Testing <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.testing) }}</Badge>
It's possible that a linting rule could be created for this potential failure. Search text nodes for icons and determine if they are the only item in the node.

## Other Test Methods

In addition to automated tests, there are other types of tests that could be conducted to prevent this potential violation.

### Developer Authored Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.author) }}</Badge>
Developers should make sure that their code does not violate this rule, and try to write a test that would prevent a regression in accessibility if the code is later changed.

### Manual Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.manual) }}</Badge>
Review page and ensure the point of failure does not exist, inspecting the DOM where required.
