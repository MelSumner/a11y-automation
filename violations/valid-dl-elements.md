## Point of Failure

Any `<dl>` elements must only contain `<dt>` and `<dd>` elements.

## Automation

### Linting

Potentially Automatable.

### Testing

See the [`axe-core`](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) library for the `definition-list` rule.

### Developer Authored Test

Developers should ensure that their code does not violate this rule, and write a test that prevents regressions in code if it is later changed.

### Manual Test

Review page and ensure the point of failure does not exist, inspecting the DOM where required.
