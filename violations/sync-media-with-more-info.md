## Point of Failure
Synchronized media that provides more information than is presented in text on the page should have captions.

## Automation

### Linting
Cannot exist yet.

### Testing
Cannot exist yet.

### Developer Authored Test
Developers should ensure that their code does not violate this rule, and write a test that prevents regressions in code if it is later changed.

### Manual Test
Review media. If more information is presented in the media than is presented in the text on the page, ensure the media has captions.
