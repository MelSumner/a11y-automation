# Potential A11y Violation:<br/>{{ $frontmatter.title }}

## Point of Failure
Synchronized media that provides more information than is presented in text on the page should have captions.

## Available Automation Evaluation

In checking known available linting and testing tools, these are our findings.

### Linting <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.linting) }}</Badge>
It does not seem possible to have an automated test for this potential failure, yet.

### Testing <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.testing) }}</Badge>
It does not seem possible to have an automated test for this potential failure, yet.

## Other Test Methods

In addition to automated tests, there are other types of tests that could be conducted to prevent this potential violation.

### Developer Authored Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.author) }}</Badge>
Developers should make sure that their code does not violate this rule, and try to write a test that would prevent a regression in accessibility if the code is later changed.

### Manual Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.manual) }}</Badge>
Review media. If more information is presented in the media than is presented in the text on the page, ensure the media has captions.
