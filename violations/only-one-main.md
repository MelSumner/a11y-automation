## Point of Failure

A document should not have more than one `main` landmark.

## Automation

### Linting

Cannot exist yet. We would need a way to identify that a specific template was a "page" template, and that it was the primary page template for the site.

### Testing

See the [`axe-core`](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) library for the `landmark-no-duplicate-main` rule.

### Developer Authored Test

Developers should ensure that their code does not violate this rule, and write a test that prevents regressions in code if it is later changed.

### Manual Test

Review page and ensure the point of failure does not exist, inspecting the DOM where required.
