# Potential A11y Violation:<br/>{{ $frontmatter.title }}

## Point of Failure

Any sound automatically played for longer than three seconds requires a mechanism for the user to turn it off.

## Available Automation Evaluation

In checking known available linting and testing tools, these are our findings.

### Linting <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.linting) }}</Badge>

It does not seem possible to have an automated test for this potential failure, yet. If you an idea about how this could be linted in an automated fashion, or are aware of an automated linting rule that already exists, please [file an issue on this app's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MelSumner/a11y-automation/issues).

### Testing <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.testing) }}</Badge>

Automated testing exists. See the [`axe-core`](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) library for the `no-autoplay-audio` rule.

## Other Test Methods

In addition to automated tests, there are other types of tests that could be conducted to prevent this potential violation.

### Developer Authored Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.author) }}</Badge>

Ideally, do not autoplay any media of any type. It is inconsiderate of users who may already have screen readers operating, or users who have noise sensitivity issues. Developers should make sure that their code does not violate this rule, and try to write a test that would prevent a regression in accessibility if the code is later changed.

### Manual Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.manual) }}</Badge>

Review page and ensure the point of failure does not exist, inspecting the DOM where required.
