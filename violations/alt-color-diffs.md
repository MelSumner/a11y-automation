# Potential A11y Violation:<br/>{{ $frontmatter.title }}

## Point of Failure

The `alt` attribute value should not include information conveyed by color differences (e.g., "click the red button to submit the form")

## Available Automation Evaluation

In checking known available linting and testing tools, these are our findings.

### Linting <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.linting) }}</Badge>

It's possible that a linting rule could be created for this potential failure. Parse `alt` attribute value and determine whether or not it contains any color words.

### Testing <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.testing) }}</Badge>

It's possible that a testing rule could be created for this potential failure. Parse `alt` attribute value and determine whether or not it contains any color words.

## Other Test Methods

In addition to automated tests, there are other types of tests that could be conducted to prevent this potential violation.

### Developer Authored Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.author) }}</Badge>

Developers should make sure that their code does not violate this rule, and try to write a test that would prevent a regression in accessibility if the code is later changed.

### Manual Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.manual) }}</Badge>

While inspecting `alt` attribute values, ensure that no information is included that conveys color differences.
