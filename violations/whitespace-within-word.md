## Point of Failure

Whitespace should not be used to control spacing within a word.

## Automation

### Linting

See the [`ember-template-lint`](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-lint) library for the `no-whitespace-within-word` rule.

### Testing

See the [`axe-core`](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) library for the `avoid-inline-spacing` rule.

### Developer Authored Test

Developers should ensure that their code does not violate this rule, and write a test that prevents regressions in code if it is later changed.

### Manual Test

Review page and ensure the point of failure does not exist, inspecting the DOM where required.
