# Potential A11y Violation:<br/>{{ $frontmatter.title }}

## Point of Failure

Buttons and links should not use non-descriptive, non-unique words or phrases as the element's text content. Examples include "read more", "more", "read about it here", "click here". 

## Available Automation Evaluation

In checking known available linting and testing tools, these are our findings.

### Linting <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.linting) }}</Badge>

See `ember-template-lint` for the `no-invalid-link-text` rule.

### Testing <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.testing) }}</Badge>

It's possible that a check could be created for this potential failure. Review the linting rule and adapt for test suite.

## Other Test Methods

In addition to automated tests, there are other types of tests that could be conducted to prevent this potential violation.

### Developer Authored Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.author) }}</Badge>

Developers should make sure that their code does not violate this rule, and try to write a test that would prevent a regression in accessibility if the code is later changed.

### Manual Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.manual) }}</Badge>

Check the page for the presence of links or buttons that have "more", "read more", or similarly not meaningful text.
