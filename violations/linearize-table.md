## Point of Failure
If a table layout is used, the linearized data should make sense.

## Automation

### Linting

Cannot Exist Yet. We don't have a way to ensure that a thing "makes sense". This requires human interaction.

If you an idea about how this could be linted in an automated fashion, or are aware of an automated linting rule that already exists, please [file an issue on this app's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MelSumner/a11y-automation/issues).

### Testing

Cannot Exist Yet. If you an idea about how this could be tested in an automated fashion, or are aware of an automated test that already exists, please [file an issue on this app's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MelSumner/a11y-automation/issues).

### Developer Authored Test
Developers may not be able to write a rule for this violation.

### Manual Test
Review page and ensure the point of failure does not exist, inspecting the DOM where required.
