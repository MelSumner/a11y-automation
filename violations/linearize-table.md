# Potential A11y Violation:<br/>{{ $frontmatter.title }}

## Point of Failure
If a table layout is used, the linearized data should make sense.

## Available Automation Evaluation

In checking known available linting and testing tools, these are our findings.

### Linting <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.linting) }}</Badge>

It does not seem possible to have an automated test for this potential failure, yet. We don't have a way to ensure that a thing "makes sense". This requires human interaction.

If you an idea about how this could be linted in an automated fashion, or are aware of an automated linting rule that already exists, please [file an issue on this app's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MelSumner/a11y-automation/issues).

### Testing <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.testing) }}</Badge>

It does not seem possible to have an automated test for this potential failure, yet. If you an idea about how this could be tested in an automated fashion, or are aware of an automated test that already exists, please [file an issue on this app's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MelSumner/a11y-automation/issues).

## Other Test Methods

In addition to automated tests, there are other types of tests that could be conducted to prevent this potential violation.

### Developer Authored Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.author) }}</Badge>
Developers may not be able to write a rule for this violation.

### Manual Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.manual) }}</Badge>
Review page and ensure the point of failure does not exist, inspecting the DOM where required.
