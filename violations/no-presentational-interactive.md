# Potential A11y Violation:<br/>{{ $frontmatter.title }}

## Point of Failure

Interactive elements should not have role="presentation" or role="none"

## Available Automation Evaluation

In checking known available linting and testing tools, these are our findings.

### Linting <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.linting) }}</Badge>

It's possible that a linting rule could be created for this potential failure. Check interactive elements for the role of presentation or the role of none.

### Testing <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.testing) }}</Badge>

See above

## Other Test Methods

In addition to automated tests, there are other types of tests that could be conducted to prevent this potential violation.

### Developer Authored Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.author) }}</Badge>

Developers should make sure that their code does not violate this rule, and try to write a test that would prevent a regression in accessibility if the code is later changed.

### Manual Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.manual) }}</Badge>

Inspect DOM for instances of `role="presentation"` and `role="none"` and ensure that they are not attached to interactive elements.
