## Point of Failure
Interactive elements should not have role="presentation" or role="none"

## Automation

### Linting
Potentially automatable. Check interactive elements for the role of presentation or the role of none.

### Testing
See above

### Developer Authored Test
Developers should ensure that their code does not violate this rule, and write a test that prevents regressions in code if it is later changed.

### Manual Test
Inspect DOM for instances of `role="presentation"` and `role="none"` and ensure that they are not attached to interactive elements.
