# Potential A11y Violation:<br/>{{ $frontmatter.title }}

## Point of Failure

Tables should not be used for layout at all. Many modern solutions exist, such as flexbox or grid in CSS.However, legacy code may need to be maintained but not updated; it still must meet accessibility criteria. In these cases, the `<th>` element should not be used in layout tables (tables marked with `role="presentation"` or `role="none"`).

## Available Automation Evaluation

In checking known available linting and testing tools, these are our findings.

### Linting <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.linting) }}</Badge>

It's possible that a linting rule could be created for this potential failure.

### Testing <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.testing) }}</Badge>

It's possible that a check could be created for this potential failure.

## Other Test Methods

In addition to automated tests, there are other types of tests that could be conducted to prevent this potential violation.

### Developer Authored Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.author) }}</Badge>

Developers should make sure that their code does not violate this rule, and try to write a test that would prevent a regression in accessibility if the code is later changed.

### Manual Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.manual) }}</Badge>

Review page and ensure the point of failure does not exist, inspecting the DOM where required.
