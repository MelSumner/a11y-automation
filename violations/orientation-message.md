# Potential A11y Violation:<br/>{{ $frontmatter.title }}

## Point of Failure

A message should not be shown that asks the user to change the orientation of the device.

## Available Automation Evaluation

In checking known available linting and testing tools, these are our findings.

### Linting <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.linting) }}</Badge>

Potentially automatable through CSS linting.

### Testing <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.testing) }}</Badge>

Potentially automatable but needs further analysis.

## Other Test Methods

In addition to automated tests, there are other types of tests that could be conducted to prevent this potential violation.

### Developer Authored Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.author) }}</Badge>

Developers should make sure that their code does not violate this rule, and try to write a test that would prevent a regression in accessibility if the code is later changed.

### Manual Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.manual) }}</Badge>

Rotate the device and ensure that a message does not appear to ask you to change your device's orientation.
