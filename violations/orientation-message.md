## Point of Failure

A message should not be shown that asks the user to change the orientation of the device.

## Automation

### Linting

Potentially automatable through CSS linting.

### Testing

Potentially automatable but needs further analysis.

### Developer Authored Test

Developers should ensure that their code does not violate this rule, and write a test that prevents regressions in code if it is later changed.

### Manual Test

Rotate the device and ensure that a message does not appear to ask you to change your device's orientation.
