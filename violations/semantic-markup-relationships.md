## Point of Failure
Structural markup should not be used in a way that does not represent relationships in the content.

## Automation

### Linting
Potentially automatable to some extent. Identify specifics of structural content and write linting rules that ensure the content is appropriate.

### Testing
See above

### Developer Authored Test
(Learn HTML, use HTML validators)

### Manual Test
Run the page's markup through an HTML validator.
