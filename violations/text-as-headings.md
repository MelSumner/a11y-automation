## Point of Failure

Images of text should not be used as headings.

## Automation

### Linting

Potentially automatable but there are a lot of violations to consider.

- how do we programmatically identify images of text
- how do we programmatically identify headings
- how do we programmatically identify that an image of text is being used as a header

### Testing

See above

### Developer Authored Test

Developers should ensure that their code does not violate this rule, and write a test that prevents regressions in code if it is later changed.

### Manual Test

Review the page. Check headings to insure they are not images of text.
