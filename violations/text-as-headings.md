# Potential A11y Violation:<br/>{{ $frontmatter.title }}

## Point of Failure

Images of text should not be used as headings.

## Available Automation Evaluation

In checking known available linting and testing tools, these are our findings.

### Linting <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.linting) }}</Badge>

Potentially automatable but there are a lot of violations to consider.

- how do we programmatically identify images of text
- how do we programmatically identify headings
- how do we programmatically identify that an image of text is being used as a header

### Testing <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.testing) }}</Badge>

See above

## Other Test Methods

In addition to automated tests, there are other types of tests that could be conducted to prevent this potential violation.

### Developer Authored Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.author) }}</Badge>

Developers should make sure that their code does not violate this rule, and try to write a test that would prevent a regression in accessibility if the code is later changed.

### Manual Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.manual) }}</Badge>

Review the page. Check headings to insure they are not images of text.
