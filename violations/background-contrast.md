## Point of Failure

Background images should provide sufficient contrast with foreground text.

## Automation

### Linting

Cannot Exist Yet. How could we programmatically evaluate the image being used as a background image and extract the right colors to use for a color contrast check?

If you an idea about how this could be linted in an automated fashion, or are aware of an automated linting rule that already exists, please [file an issue on this app's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MelSumner/a11y-automation/issues).

### Testing

Cannot Exist Yet. If you an idea about how this could be tested in an automated fashion, or are aware of an automated test that already exists, please [file an issue on this app's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MelSumner/a11y-automation/issues).

### Developer Authored Test

Developers should ensure that their code does not violate this rule, and write a test that prevents regressions in code if it is later changed.

### Manual Test

Review page and ensure the point of failure does not exist, inspecting the DOM where required.
