# Potential A11y Violation:<br/>{{ $frontmatter.title }}

## Point of Failure

Content should not be identified only through its shape or location (e.g., "the button on the bottom right", or "the round button")

## Available Automation Evaluation

In checking known available linting and testing tools, these are our findings.

### Linting <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.linting) }}</Badge>

Potentially automatable but in a limited fashion. It could be a little tricky, but perhaps a dictionary of shape and location phrases could be created, and strings of text could be compared against that dictionary.

### Testing <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.testing) }}</Badge>

Potentially automatable but in a limited fashion.

## Other Test Methods

In addition to automated tests, there are other types of tests that could be conducted to prevent this potential violation.

### Developer Authored Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.author) }}</Badge>

Developers should educate themselves about this rule, and avoid it while creating code.

### Manual Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.manual) }}</Badge>

Review page and ensure the point of failure does not exist, inspecting the DOM where required.
