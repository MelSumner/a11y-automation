If you think it can, please [file an issue on this app's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MelSumner/a11y-automation/issues).

### Testing <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.testing) }}</Badge>

Cannot exist yet; how could a machine determine this? No current method exists to test captions produced to accompany video. If you think it can, please [file an issue on this app's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MelSumner/a11y-automation/issues).

## Other Test Methods

In addition to automated tests, there are other types of tests that could be conducted to prevent this potential violation.

### Developer Authored Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.author) }}</Badge>

Developers should consider whether or not they could write an app test for captions; if not, ensure that manual testing is completed.

### Manual Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.manual) }}</Badge>

Watch video and ensure that captions do not exclude any dialog or descriptions of important sounds.
