## Point of Failure

Captions should not exclude any of the dialog or description of important sounds.

## Automation

### Linting

No current method exists to lint video or the quality of video captions, so this cannot exist yet.

If you think it can, please [file an issue on this app's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MelSumner/a11y-automation/issues).

### Testing

Cannot exist yet; how could a machine determine this? No current method exists to test captions produced to accompany video. If you think it can, please [file an issue on this app's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MelSumner/a11y-automation/issues).

### Developer Authored Test

Developers should consider whether or not they could write an app test for captions; if not, ensure that manual testing is completed.

### Manual Test

Watch video and ensure that captions do not exclude any dialog or descriptions of important sounds.
