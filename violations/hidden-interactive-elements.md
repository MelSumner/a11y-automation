# Potential A11y Violation:<br/>{{ $frontmatter.title }}

## Point of Failure
Elements with the `aria-hidden` attribute should not contain focusable (interactive) elements.

## Available Automation Evaluation

In checking known available linting and testing tools, these are our findings.

### Linting <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.linting) }}</Badge>
It's possible that a linting rule could be created for this potential failure.

### Testing <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.testing) }}</Badge>
See the [`axe-core`](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) library for the `aria-hidden-focus` rule.

## Other Test Methods

In addition to automated tests, there are other types of tests that could be conducted to prevent this potential violation.

### Developer Authored Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.author) }}</Badge>
Developers should make sure that their code does not violate this rule, and try to write a test that would prevent a regression in accessibility if the code is later changed.

### Manual Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.manual) }}</Badge>
Review page and ensure the point of failure does not exist, inspecting the DOM where required.
