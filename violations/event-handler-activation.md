# Potential A11y Violation:<br/>{{ $frontmatter.title }}

## Point of Failure

A pointing-device-specific event handler should not be the only means of activating an event handler for a function.

## Available Automation Evaluation

In checking known available linting and testing tools, these are our findings.

### Linting <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.linting) }}</Badge>

It does not seem possible to have an automated test for this potential failure, yet. If you an idea about how this could be linted in an automated fashion, or are aware of an automated linting rule that already exists, please [file an issue on this app's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MelSumner/a11y-automation/issues).

### Testing <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.testing) }}</Badge>

It does not seem possible to have an automated test for this potential failure, yet. If you an idea about how this could be tested in an automated fashion, or are aware of an automated test that already exists, please [file an issue on this app's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MelSumner/a11y-automation/issues).

## Other Test Methods

In addition to automated tests, there are other types of tests that could be conducted to prevent this potential violation.

### Developer Authored Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.author) }}</Badge>

Developers should ensure that their code does not violate this rule by ensuring that if a device-specific event handler invokes a function, a keyboard should also be able to invoke the same function. Write a test that prevents regressions in code if it is later changed.

### Manual Test <Badge type="info">{{ normalize($frontmatter.manual) }}</Badge>

Review page and ensure the point of failure does not exist, inspecting the DOM where required.
